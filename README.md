# agffranklen-Healthcare-Monitoring-using-Line-Follower-Robot-Using-LiFi
The project integrates a line-following robot with Li-Fi for automated healthcare monitoring. It autonomously navigates hospital corridors, delivering medicines and collecting patient data via biosensors. Li-Fi ensures fast, interference-free transmission, improving hospital automation, emergency response, and contactless healthcare.
